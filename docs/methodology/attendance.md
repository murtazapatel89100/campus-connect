# Attendance System for Campus Connect App

This document outlines the **objectives, workflow, system design, and future enhancements** for the Campus Connect attendance module.

---

## 1. OBJECTIVE

The attendance system is designed to:

- Allow teachers to **mark attendance easily**
- Enable students to **record attendance via QR code**
- Optionally validate attendance with **facial recognition**
- Ensure **accuracy, security, and scalability** for large classes

---

## 2. WORKFLOW OVERVIEW

### Teacher Login & Class Selection

- Teachers authenticate via **role-based access control (RBAC)**
- They select the **class/session** for which attendance needs to be taken

### Attendance Marking (Student Side)

- **Primary Method:** Students scan a **QR code** displayed by the teacher or generated for the session
- **Optional Method:** Facial recognition can validate student identity during scanning

### Data Storage (PostgreSQL)

- Attendance records are stored in **PostgreSQL** with references to:
  - `student_id`
  - `class_id`
  - `timestamp`
  - `method` (QR / face)
- **Database indexes** ensure efficient querying, even for large classes

### Teacher Access & Verification

- Teachers can **review attendance records in real-time**
- Optional **manual adjustments** can be made for exceptions

### Student Access

- Students can **view their attendance** on their dashboard
- **Attendance percentages** are automatically calculated and updated

### Notifications & Reports

- Students may receive **alerts for absences or low attendance**
- Teachers can **download attendance reports** for analysis or record-keeping

## 3. SYSTEM DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

- **Scalability:** PostgreSQL indexing ensures fast retrieval for large numbers of students
- **Security:** Only authorized users can update attendance; **API endpoints protected via JWT authentication**
- **Maintainability:** Modular API design allows easy addition of features like face validation or integration with timetable systems
- **Real-Time Updates:** Future implementations may include **Socket.IO** for instant updates across dashboards

---

## 4. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

- Full **facial recognition integration** as a primary method for attendance
- Integration with **academic performance systems** for analytics
- **Cross-platform support** for mobile apps to mark/view attendance on the go
