# Methodology (RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT)

This document outlines the methodology adopted to design, develop, and deploy **Campus Connect**, ensuring that the application is **research-backed, scalable, and maintainable**.

---

## 1. RESEARCH & REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS

- Conducted a **literature review** of existing academic papers, prototypes, and similar campus apps.
- Identified **gaps in current solutions** (e.g., fragmented communication, poor attendance tracking, lack of alumni-student interaction).
- Validated features with **references from published research articles and official technology documentation**.
- **Outcome:** Feature list includes **attendance monitoring, event management, real-time notifications, and alumni networking**.

---

## 2. TECHNOLOGY STACK SELECTION

- **Frontend:** Next.js (**server-side rendering, SEO, scalability**)
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js (**API-driven, modular, scalable**)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (**relational DB, indexing, ACID-compliant, scalable**)
- **Package Manager:** pnpm (**efficient, disk-space saving dependency management**)
- **Hosting & Deployment:** Vercel + Docker containers (**microservice-based deployment**)
- **Rationale:** Chosen stack aligns with **modern cloud-native development and scalability best practices**

---

## 3. SYSTEM DESIGN & ARCHITECTURE

- Adopted **microservices architecture** for modular scalability
- Implemented **API-first design** to support future mobile applications
- Added **authentication & role-based access control (RBAC)** for secure operations

---

## 4. DEPLOYMENT METHODOLOGY

- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub with **feature-branch workflow**
- **CI/CD:** Automated **testing and deployment pipelines**
- **Containerization:** Docker for **consistent builds and cross-environment reliability**
- **Hosting:** Vercel for frontend + **scalable cloud backend for APIs**
- **Environment Handling:** `.env.local` auto-generated on install for easier setup

---

## 5. SCALABILITY CONSIDERATIONS

- **Database Scaling:** PostgreSQL **indexing, partitioning, and query optimization**
- **Application Scaling:** Load balancers + **horizontal scaling** of microservices
- **Caching:** Redis for **session and query optimization**
- **Monitoring:** Integrated logging tools for **performance tracking**

---

## 6. MAINTENANCE & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

- Structured **branching strategy**: feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/\*
- Regular **dependency audits and updates** to maintain security
- Adopted **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** for maintainability
- Defined **issue tracking and documentation standards**
- Planned **user feedback cycles** for iterative improvements
