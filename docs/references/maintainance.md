## 3. MAINTENANCE

**Conceptual Insight:**  
Well-maintained software minimizes downtime, facilitates updates, and ensures security.

**Reference Example:**

- Literature on **software maintainability** highlights **modular code**, **automated testing**, and **version control** as key practices.
- **CI/CD workflows** in modern apps reduce manual deployment errors.

**How it influenced your app:**

- **Modular folder structure** separates features (frontend, backend, docs).
- **Automated testing** (unit + integration) ensures new updates donâ€™t break existing features.
- **GitHub Actions** or similar **CI/CD pipelines** automate deployment and alerts for failed builds.
