# Data Privacy Compliance for Campus Connect

Campus Connect is committed to ensuring that all data handling and processing practices comply with **Indian government regulations** regarding privacy and storage of sensitive data, especially in educational institutions.

## 1. Legal Context

The **Government of India** and the **University Grants Commission (UGC)** have strict guidelines on the collection and storage of **biometric and facial data** of students.

Key points:

- Universities are **not allowed to store sensitive biometric information**, including facial scans, fingerprints, or iris data.
- Collection or storage of **Aadhaar data** for academic or attendance purposes is **strictly prohibited** unless explicitly mandated and authorized by law.
- Violating these rules may result in **legal penalties**, institutional sanctions, and privacy breaches.

## 2. Campus Connect Approach

To comply with these regulations while still offering secure attendance verification, Campus Connect implements the following measures:

1. **Facial Check via College ID / Registration Data**
   - Instead of storing actual facial biometric data, the app **uses the student’s photograph already present on their college ID or registration records**.
   - Facial recognition is performed **temporarily during attendance verification**, and **no raw images or biometric templates are stored** in the database.

2. **No Aadhaar or Government-Linked Biometric Data**
   - Campus Connect **does not request or process Aadhaar numbers, fingerprints, or any government-issued biometric information**.
   - This ensures **full compliance with UGC and Indian privacy regulations**.

3. **Secure Temporary Processing**
   - Any face comparison operations happen **on the device or in a secure ephemeral processing pipeline**.
   - Only **attendance status (present/absent)** is recorded in the database; no sensitive biometric information is persisted.

## 3. Benefits

- **Regulatory Compliance:** Fully adheres to Indian laws regarding sensitive data in universities.
- **Student Privacy:** Protects students from potential misuse of biometric data.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Enables attendance verification without compromising privacy or legality.
- **Future-Proof:** The system can adapt to further guidelines on data protection (e.g., India’s Personal Data Protection Bill).

## 4. Summary

Campus Connect’s attendance system is designed to be **privacy-aware, legally compliant, and secure**. By leveraging existing college ID photographs and registration data, we provide **facial validation without storing sensitive biometric data**, avoiding the legal and ethical issues associated with Aadhaar or other biometric information.
